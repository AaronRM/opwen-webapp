"The Lokole is a small device that creates a local network: the Lokole "
"WiFi. You can connect to this network with any device: your phone, your "
"tablet or your laptop. Once on the network, you access the Lokole website"
" where you read and write emails via your Ascoderu account. Once per day,"
" when the cost of bandwidth is cheapest the Lokole then transmits "
"everyone's emails to the cloud. In this way, many people can pool their "
"resources to make email available for everyone."
